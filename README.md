# Hello, I'm Mustafa SelÃ§uk Ã‡aÄŸlar ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a EEM with a passion for computers, embedded systems and artificial intelligence. With 2 years of experience in system programing, I have developed a strong understanding of C/C++, POSIX/Unix/Linux, Qt, Networking. I enjoy walking at seaside, and I'm always excited to learn and explore new things.

## What am i doing?
- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on POSIX/Unix/Linux System programing for payment systems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning what i working on it + Qt/Qml + CMake + Docker
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on readers and smart cards
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with 
  - some special networking stuff to communicating devices. I am good at but some issues cannot resolve without test.
  - Prepearing build enviroments. I am not a system admin. So that i have enough information about command details.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about [my skills](#skills)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Just send me message or open an issue.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Procrastinating
- âš¡ Fun fact: We are looking to find aliens but we are aliens.

## Projects
### Speech Enhancement Generative Adversarial Network - Master Thesis
- Description: The Speech Enhancement Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is the subject of my master's thesis, focusing on improving the quality of speech signals by removing noise. The GAN architecture is employed to learn from the surrounding environment and effectively enhance speech signals by suppressing unwanted noise. The goal is to develop an advanced and efficient system that can enhance speech clarity and intelligibility.
- Technologies used: Python, PyTorch
- GitHub Repository: [MasterThesis](https://github.com/develooper1994/MasterThesis)

### RCScalculator1
- Description: RCScalculator1 is a radar cross-section (RCS) calculator, a powerful tool for analyzing and evaluating the radar signature of objects. This calculator enables users to estimate the scattering properties of various targets and understand their detectability by radar systems. It is designed to provide accurate and reliable results for RCS calculations.
- Technologies used: C#, C, HTML, MATLAB, Python, Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub Repository: [RCScalculator1](https://github.com/develooper1994/RCScalculator1)

### RCScalculator2
- Description: RCScalculator2 is another radar cross-section (RCS) calculator, developed as a companion tool to RCScalculator1. It offers advanced features and additional capabilities for analyzing and simulating the radar signature of objects. With a focus on accuracy and flexibility, RCScalculator2 provides enhanced functionality for RCS calculations.
- Technologies used: C#, C, HTML, MATLAB, Python, Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub Repository: [RCScalculator2](https://github.com/develooper1994/RCScalculator2)

### Commander
- Description: Commander is a meticulously crafted process management library, designed with an intuitive and user-friendly approach. I have personally developed this library for my projects, harnessing the power of Qt6. Commander provides developers with efficient and effective process management capabilities, enabling seamless control and handling of processes within their applications.
- Technologies used: C++, Qt6
- GitHub Repository: [Commander](https://github.com/develooper1994/Commander)

### udpmanager
- Description: udpmanager is a meticulously crafted process management library, named Commander, designed to be user-friendly and easy to use.
